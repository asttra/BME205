## Bioinformatics Models and Algorithms (UCSC - BME 205)

In the fall of 2013 I took a course in bioinformatics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  I took this course to gage my interest in the field of bioinformatics and also to sharpen my programing skills.  Here I present the programs I wrote for this course.

### Course Description

Covers bioinformatics models and algorithms: the use of computational techniques to convert the masses of information from biochemical experiments (DNA sequencing, DNA chips, and other high-throughput experimental methods) into useful information. Emphasis is on DNA and protein sequence alignment and analysis.

This was a warrm up exercise.

#### HW2 - Blah blah
